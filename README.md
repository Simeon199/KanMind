# KanMind Backend

This is a backend built using Django and Django REST Framework, designed specifically for task management on Kanban boards. It fully supports CRUD operations and serves as the Python equivalent of the Join app's backend. 
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Simeon199/KanMind.git
  cd KanMind
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash

python -m venv env

# For Windows, activate with:
env\Scripts\activate

# For Linux/mcOS, activate with:
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Prerequisites
To get started with running the application locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Django 5.1 or higher
- Django REST Framework
- Optional but highly recommended: Postman for testing API endpoints
