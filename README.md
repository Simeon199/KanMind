# KanMind Backend

This is a backend implemented with Django and Django REST Framework, which was created for task management with Kanban boards and fully supports CRUD operations. It represents virtually the Python backend of the Join app.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Simeon199/KanMind.git
  cd KanMind
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash

python -m venv env

# Setup for Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# Setup for Linux/mcOS:
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Prerequisites
To run the application on your local machine, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Django 5.1 or higher
- Django REST Framework
- Postman (optional but very useful to test the API endpoints)
